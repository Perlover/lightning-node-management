To create inbound liquidity on an existing channel \(to be able to receive payments\) can simply pay a merchant accepting Lightning and receive the product or receive the sats back on-chain.

## Dual funded channels
### C-lightning dual funded channels on the protocol level
* [How to use on the RaspiBlitz](https://github.com/rootzoll/raspiblitz/blob/v1.7/FAQ.cl.md#dual-funded-channels)
* [Open a dual funded channel](https://medium.com/blockstream/c-lightning-opens-first-dual-funded-mainnet-lightning-channel-ada6b32a527c)

## Buy inbound channels
### Comparison table of lightning channel markets
* [channelmarkets.md](https://github.com/openoms/lightning-node-management/blob/en/channelmarkets.md)

### [Amboss Magma](https://amboss.space)
* lightning liquidity marketpalce

### [zerofeerouting.com](https://zerofeerouting.com/)
* The price for the channel depends on the size and can be calculated as:
  ```
  [size] * 0.005 - 2,000
  ```
  A 10M channel (0.1 BTC) would cost 48,000 sats.

## Swap out

Pay with Lightning and receive onchain.

### [Lightning Loop](https://github.com/lightninglabs/loop)

Lightning Loop is a non-custodial service offered by Lightning Labs to bridge on-chain and off-chain Bitcoin using submarine swaps.

In the current iteration of the Loop software, two swap types are supported:

* Loop Out: off-chain to on-chain. The Loop client sends funds paid on Lightning to a Bitcoin address.
* Loop In: on-chain to off-chain. The Loop client sends funds paid on-chain to a Lightning channel.
* Max swap amount: 4 200 000 sats
* Example usage for lowest cost \(leads to longer confirmation time \(estimation for 25 blocks\) and higher failure rate \(max routing fee 500 sats\) - adjust the numbers accordingly\):  
  `loop out --conf_target 25 --max_swap_routing_fee 500 4200000 [optional external address]`

  ```text
     loop out [command options] amt [addr]

    # --channel value               the 8-byte compact channel ID of the channel to loop out (default: 0)
    # --addr value                  the optional address that the looped out funds should be sent to, if let blank the funds will go to lnd's wallet
    # --amt value                   the amount in satoshis to loop out (default: 0)
    # --conf_target value           the number of blocks from the swap initiation height that the on-chain HTLC should be swept within (default: 6)
    # --max_swap_routing_fee value  the max off-chain swap routing fee in satoshis, if let blank a default max fee will be used (default: 0)
    # --fast                        Indicate you want to swap immediately, paying potentially a higher fee. If not set the swap server might choose to wait up to 30 minutes before publishing the swap HTLC on-chain, to save on chain fees. Not setting this flag might result in a lower swap fee.
  ```

## Send to a mobile wallet
Most can send to an onchain address afterwards for a fee (swap out).

### Self-custodial wallets

Run a separate LN node on your phone or desktop where you can move some funds, so remote balance/ inbound liquidity is created

* [Breez](https://breez.technology/)

  A mobile wallet which creates a 1 million sats incoming channel automatically, so funds can be moved over in minutes after setting up.

  Sending the funds out to a bitcoin address on-chain costs 0.5% with [Boltz](https://boltz.exchange/)

* [Phoenix](https://phoenix.acinq.co/)

  Run a Lightning Node on Android, iOS or desktop. Channels are managed manually or by the autopilot.

* [Muun Wallet](https://muun.com/)

  An easy-to-use cross platform lightning wallet.

* [Blixt wallet](https://blixtwallet.github.io/)
  
  A non-custodial open-source Lightning Wallet for Android and iOS with a focus on usability and user experience.

* [Simple Bitcoin Wallet](https://lightning-wallet.com/)  
  Simple Bitcoin Wallet (aka SBW) is an open-source, non-custodial, autonomous wallet for Android  devices which can store, send and receive bitcoins.  
  On top of that SBW provides an extensive Lightning Network support and is capable of sending,  receiving and routing of Lightning payments. 

### Custodial wallets

Pay yourself via LN and benefit from the inbound liquidity created.

The drawback is that you don't control the keys of your custodial wallet.

Examples:
* [Wallet of Satoshi](https://www.walletofsatoshi.com/)
* [Bluewallet](https://bluewallet.io/)
* [Bitcoin Beach ](https://galoy.io/)
* [Tippin.me](https://tippin.me/)
